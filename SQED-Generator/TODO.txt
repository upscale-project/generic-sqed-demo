- Add more error detection in parser + generators (maybe).
- Create format file checker that informs user of potential issues - like including fields that are not defined.
- Create a detailed README for tool.
- Clean up and comment code.
- Try out new ISAs and create case study sub-directories in git repo that are complete for a demo (and work).
- Release another public version of the tool.
- Make tool generate the cache and mux files in case instructions are different bit-widths.
- Figure out a method to help wire SQED to a processor (move qed_ready signal logic, think of a new way / automate).
- Is there a way to generate the format file / make a tool that can help the user generate it. 

- Generate .ssts files for SIC
- Fixes in SIC_generator.py
- Need tool to generalize better (try another ISA)
